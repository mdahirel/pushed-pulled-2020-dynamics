This is the folder containing the raw experimental data for this experiment, as well as metadata on the microsatellites used:

- `Trichogramma_dynamics.csv` and `Trichogramma_genetics.csv` contain raw data about (estimated) population sizes in each populated patch, and microsatellite data for the individuals that were genotyped, respectively (+ fields from which we can extract treatment, location, time, replicate... information). See script 1 for more details

- `Trichogramma_microsatellite_description.csv` contains metadata about the microsatellite loci we used (primer, motif). These informations are all displayed, with more context, in Supplementary Material S4.
