If you want to re-knit the supplementary material `html` document from scratch:

- if you have unzipped all the archived models (see `README` in the parent folder), just knit, should work; 
- if you haven't, I'd advise you to first run each model individually and save them, and then knit once you have everything, since it may take a lot of time to fit every model (up to a few days, depending on computer. Don't forget you must also run the "main analysis" models for the supplementary material to knit right, not just the model written in the supplementary material file itself).
